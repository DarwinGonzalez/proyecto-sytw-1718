# Conclusiones

As a final conclusion we can determine that the VUEJS is a great programming language, that undoubtedly will be one of the main protagonists in the following years. The great ease with which this programming language can be learned will help to programmers do the same things but in a easier way and not wasting hours and hours trying to learning old programings languages that are much more difficult.

On the other hand doing this work on VUEJS we have learned several things about the language that we have been able to implement in the final project of this subject, There is no doubt that it has been very interesting for our group to face this new challenge called VUEJS.

But not everything has been easy with VUEJS, the documentation becomes scarce due to the fact that its developers are from Asia and the language barrier hinders the free transit of knowledge, but we are totally confident in our group that when the use of this language will increased and a lot of documentation of this programming language will be created, it'll be a matter of time.

Finally, as a final conclusion, we advise you to use VUEJS tools in your projects because they will be greatly facilitate the development of better, more flexible and faster applications with an easy-to-understand code.
